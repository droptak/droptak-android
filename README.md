MapTak
=====

**IMPORTANT NOTE SERIOUSLY GUYS READ THIS**

Due to a git problem introduced by someone, not pointing fingers, 
*cough* Kyle *cough*, we have split off the Android app into its own repository.

That came with some changes. Most noticibly, the Android app was moved into a new directory.

**Everyone working on the android app needs to do this**

1. Android studio -> File -> Close project

2. Import project -> wherever-you're-at/maptak-android/maptak

ADD THIS FOLDER. The folder named "maptak". It should have a little gradle icon next to it.

3. If you have any errors, message on Google+.
